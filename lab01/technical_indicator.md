Definition:
- Technical indicators are heuristic or pattern-based signals used within technical analysis to     predict future price movements. By leveraging data such as price, volume, and open interest,   traders can identify strategic entry and exit points. Common indicators include the Relative Strength Index (RSI), Money Flow Index (MFI), and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD).

Different Categories of Technical Indicators:
  1. Overlays: Technical indicators that use the same scale as prices are plotted over the top of the prices on a stock chart. Examples include moving averages and Bollinger Bands.
  2. Oscillators: Technical indicators that oscillate between a local minimum and maximum are plotted above or below a price chart. Examples include the stochastic oscillator, MACD, or RSI.
